            Over the past decade, we developed expertise and trust within the
            industry, and came together under Eclipse Construction to reinforce
            our core values: honesty, integrity, and customer service. We pride
            ourselves on being a team property owners can whole-heartedly trust.

            Our crew is committed to the highest standards of fairness,

            team. From our office personnel to our project managers, you can
            trust that every Eclipse Construction employee is actively
