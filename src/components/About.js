        Over the past decade, we developed expertise and trust within the
        industry, and came together under Eclipse Construction to reinforce our
        core values: honesty, integrity, and customer service. We pride
        ourselves on being a team property owners can whole-heartedly trust.

      <p className='max-w-[700px]'>
        Our crew is committed to the highest standards of fairness, efficiency,
        and quality workmanship â€“ both individually and as a team. From our
        office personnel to our project managers, you can trust that every
        Eclipse Construction employee is actively contributing to the vision you
        have for your post-storm home.
